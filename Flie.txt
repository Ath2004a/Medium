$ Using (hono) lib in Medium => backend.

$ Will have 5 routers.
1. Sign up
2. Sign in
3. Update
4. Delete 
5. GET the block

$ Connect the connection-pool and database through (Connection-string).

$ Create the prisma Schema User & Post.

$ Migrate the prisma Schema.

$ npx prisma generate --no-engine (generate the client)

$ npm install @prisma/extension-accelerate (generate the @prisma/extension-accelerate)

$ /*const app = new Hono<{
  $  Bindings:{
  $    DATABASE_URL: string
  $  }
  $}>(); */   

  $ => The problem was creating with that the database URL because it was not a string. So we have to convert this in the string like this ^^

$ Then we made a folder called route which contains A blog routes and user routes.
    => In blog routes, all the blog routes are available such as.Update, delete and finding a data.
    => In user router all the user routers such as sign-in & up.

$ Then we created the middleware in a blog router file. Where we can do the authentication
    => using header
    => JWT also

$ In the middle where we use the set() and get().

$ Then we create a zod validation. But the problem occurs that we cannot use it in the front end. So we created a common folder where we can use one packet as well as front end.
